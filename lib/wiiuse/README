Windows
=======
Compiling the wiiuse library requires installation of
the windows driver development kit (DDT).
While the wiiuse project is part of the windows STK solution,
it is not compiled by default, instead the lib is 
linked from the dependency package (and output of the
wiiuse project is in the dependency directory as well).
Reason is that compiling this lib needs two hardcoded
paths to be set, which are not portable (see properties
of the wiiuse project, then Configuration, C/C++, 
General: Additional Include Directories):
first the standard VS include path (!!), THEN the
include path for the windows DDK. Without those
settings in this order wiiuse can not be compiled 
(known problems when compiling ddk code with
Visual Studio - google it). Also the path to the ddk
must be set as additional library directory.
