Basically 4 setups are included in the vc8-project:
---------------------------------------------------
The first one is the one currently used and supported,
the others are more 'historical' and will be remove soon.
  
BulletDebug/BulletRelease:
  main setup (Debug/Relase) + BULLET
  The debug version links in the optimised bullet (and sdl and plib) versions, since i is assumed that
  mostly STK is being debugged, not everything. Using debug for everything creates a really slow executable.
  
ReplayDebug/ReplayRelease:
  main setup (Debug/Relase) + HAVE_GHOST_REPLAY
  
Debug/Release: 
  main setup with openAL & vorbis: HAVE_OPENAL + HAVE_OGGVORBIS

PlibSoundDebug/PlibSoundRelease:
  no ogg-sound, no openAL, no vorbis, it is gonna be obsolete, when we move to OpenAL/ogg-vorbis completely
  

Create these environment-vars pointing to the folders of your installations:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STK_LIB: pointing to a directory containing all libs
STK_INCLUDE: pointing to a directory containing all header files.
A separate package will be made available which contains all necessary windows
files to compile STK. If you prefer to have the packages in separate
directories, please add your directories to the paths in visual studio.

Add the folders of the runtime-dlls to the PATH-variable, this is what i had to put:
(or copy the .dll files in the root directory of supertuxkart).

Remarks for OpenAL-installation:
--------------------------------
My version of OpenAL 1.1-SDK didn't put its includes in OpenAL/include/AL but in OpenAL/include. 
if yours did the same, create the folder OpenAL/include/AL and copy all the includes there.
