/** This class manages all powerups. It reads in powerup.xml to get the data,
 *  initialise the static member of some flyables (i.e. powerup.xml contains
 *  info about cakes, plunger etc which needs to be stored), and maintains
 *  the 'weights' (used in randomly chosing which item was collected) for all 
 *  items depending on position. The latter is done so that as the first player
 *  you get less advantageous items (but no useless ones either, e.g. anchor),
 *  while as the last you get more useful ones.
 *  The weight distribution works as follow:
 *  The position in a race is mapped to one of five position classes:
 *  first, top, middle, bottom, last - e.g. for a 6 player game the distribution
 *  is:
 *  position  1     2   3      4      5      6 
 *  class     first top middle middle bottom last
 *  For each class the weight distribution is read in from powerup.xml:
 *   <!--      bubble cake bowl zipper plunger switch para anvil -->
 *   <last  w="0      1    1    2      2       0      2    2"     />
 *  So a (well, in this case 'the') player belonging to the class 'last'
 *  will not get a bubble gum or switch. Cakes and bowling balls have
 *  lower probability. 
 *  At the start of each race two mappings are computed in updateWeightsForRace:
 *  m_position_to_class maps each postion to the class using the function
 *                      convertPositionToClass.
 *  m_powerups_for_position contains a list of items for each class. A item
 *  with higher weight is included more than once, so at runtime we can
 *  just pick a random item from this list to get the right distribution.
 *  In the example above the list for 'last' will be:
 *  [cake, bowling,zipper,zipper,plunger,plunger,parachute,parachute,
 *   anvil,anvil.
