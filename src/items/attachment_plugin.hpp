  *  used to handle attachment specific data so that the attachment class
  *  that is used in every kart isn't overloaded. It could be done by
  *  inheriting from Attachment, but then every time an attachment is
  *  changed, we could delete and create a new SceneNode. To avoid this
  *  overhead, we use plugins to encapsulate additional code for some
  *  plugins.
