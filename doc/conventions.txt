Here are the guidelines to follow when coding SuperTuxKart:

Filenames
=========

The filenames should be, with underscores between words. Use the .cpp
extension for C++ implementation files and .hpp for C++ headers, .c for
C files and .h for C headers.


Coding style
============

The coding style used in Super Tux Kart can be found at
http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/Coding_Style


Documentation line length
=========================

All the documentation files should have at most 80 characters, because
on some displays and on paper you often are limited to 80 characters, and
also under some conditions appendices (for example, line numbers) are
added. The exception if the player's manual, because it's long, so to
understand it better it should be limited to 65 characters.
