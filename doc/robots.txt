To create a robot, here is what you should do:

- There is a template for the robots in the src/robots directory, modify it
  to create your own robot, the files are named empty_robot.cpp and
  empty_robot.hpp .
- Name your source file <name of robot>_robot.cpp, and your header as
  <name of robot>_robot.hpp .
- Place your source and header file in the src/robot/ directory.
- Add your filenames to the Makefile.am in the src/ directory.
- In the file src/world.cpp, under the group of #includes, add
  #include "robots/<header file name>", then add your robot inside
  function World::loadRobot to the switch statement as the next case
  available, and increase the constant NUM_ROBOTS by one.
- To test it, run 'sh reconf.sh'. It should reconfigure your build and then
  compile STK.
