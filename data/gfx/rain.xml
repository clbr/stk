  Particle system to simulate it's raining heavily over an item/kart.
  It should be applied no matter if kart is flying or on (any) ground,
  and rotate to always fire up, it just simulates the rain bouncing
  off the kart and being fired by wheels. It could also be applied to
  bowling balls, for example.
